== What's new in Spring Integration 5.0?

This chapter provides an overview of the new features and improvements that have been introduced with Spring
Integration 5.0.
If you are interested in more details, please see the Issue Tracker tickets that were resolved as part of the 5.0
development process.

[[x5.0-new-components]]
=== New Components

==== Java DSL

The separate https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-java-dsl[Spring Integration Java DSL] project has now been merged into the core Spring Integration project.
The `IntegrationComponentSpec` implementations for channel adapters and gateways are distributed to their specific modules.
See <<spring-integration-endpoints>> for more information about Java DSL support for target protocol integration.
Also see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/wiki/Spring-Integration-4.3-to-5.0-Migration-Guide#java-dsl[4.3 to 5.0 Migration Guide] for the required steps to move to Spring Integration 5.0.

==== Testing Support

A new Spring Integration Test Framework has been created to assist with testing Spring Integration applications.
Now, with the `@SpringIntegrationTest` annotation on test class and `MockIntegration` factory you can make your JUnit tests for integration flows somewhat easier.
See <<testing>> for more information.

==== MongoDB Outbound Gateway

The new `MongoDbOutboundGateway` allows you to make queries to the database on demand by sending a message to its request channel.
See <<mongodb-outbound-gateway>> for more information.

==== HTTP Async Outbound Gateway and Channel Adapter

The new `AsyncHttpRequestExecutingMessageHandler` adds support for `AsyncRestTemplate` for outbound channel adapter and gateway.
See <<AsyncHttpRequestExecutingMessageHandler>> for more information.

==== Content Type Conversion

Now that we use the new `InvocableHandlerMethod` -based infrastructure for service method invocations, we can perform `contentType` conversion from payload to target method argument.
See <<content-type-conversion>> for more information.


[[x5.0-general]]
=== General Changes

Spring Integration is now fully based on Spring Framework `5.0` and Project Reactor `3.0`.
Previous Project Reactor versions are no longer supported.

==== Core Changes

The `@Poller` annotation now has the `errorChannel` attribute for easier configuration of the underlying `MessagePublishingErrorHandler`.
See <<annotations>> for more information.

All the request-reply endpoints (based on `AbstractReplyProducingMessageHandler`) can now start transaction and, therefore, make the whole downstream flow transactional.
See <<tx-handle-message-advice>> for more information.

The `SmartLifecycleRoleController` now provides methods to obtain status of endpoints in roles.
See <<endpoint-roles>> for more information.

POJO methods are now invoked using an `InvocableHandlerMethod` by default, but can be configured to use SpEL as before.
See <<pojo-invocation>> for more information.

When targeting POJO methods as message handlers, one of the service methods can now be marked with the `@Default` annotation to provide a fallback mechanism for non-matched conditions.
See <<service-activator-namespace>> for more information.

A simple `PassThroughTransactionSynchronizationFactory` is provided to always store a polled message in the current transaction context.
That message is used as a `failedMessage` property of the `MessagingException` which wraps a raw exception thrown during transaction completion.
See <<transaction-synchronization>> for more information.

The aggregator expression-based `ReleaseStrategy` now evaluates the expression against the `MesageGroup` instead of just the collection of `Message<?>`.
See <<aggregator-spel>> for more information.

==== JMS Changes

Previously, Spring Integration JMS XML configuration used a default bean name `connectionFactory` for the JMS Connection Factory, allowing the property to be omitted from component definitions.
It has now been renamed to `jmsConnectionFactory`, which is the bean name used by Spring Boot to auto-configure the JMS Connection Factory bean.

If your application is relying on the previous behavior, rename your `connectionFactory` bean to `jmsConnectionFactory`, or specifically configure your components to use your bean using its current name.

==== Gateway Changes

The gateway now correctly sets the `errorChannel` header when the gateway method has a `void` return type and an error channel is provided.
Previously, the header was not populated.
This had the effect that synchronous downstream flows (running on the calling thread) would send the exception to the configured channel but an exception on an async downstream flow would be sent to the default `errorChannel` instead.

The `RequestReplyExchanger` interface now has a `throws MessagingException` clause to meet all the proposed messages exchange contract.

See <<gateway-error-handling>> for more information.

==== Mail Changes

Some inconsistencies with rendering IMAP mail content have been resolved.
See <<imap-format-important, the note in the Mail-Receiving Channel Adapter Section>> for more information.

==== Feed Changes

Instead of the `com.rometools.fetcher.FeedFetcher`, which is deprecated in ROME, a new `Resource` property has been introduced to the `FeedEntryMessageSource`.
See <<feed>> for more information.


==== File Changes

The new `FileHeaders.RELATIVE_PATH` Message header has been introduced to represent relative path in the `FileReadingMessageSource`.
See <<file-reading>> for more information.

The tail adapter now supports `idleEventInterval` to emit events when there is no data in the file during that period.
See <<file-tailing>> for more information.

The flush predicates for the `FileWritingMessageHandler` now have an additional parameter.
See <<file-flushing>> for more information.

The file outbound channel adapter (`FileWritingMessageHandler`) now supports the `REPLACE_IF_MODIFIED` `FileExistsMode`.

==== (S)FTP Changes

The inbound channel adapters now have a property `max-fetch-size` which is used to limit the number of files fetched during a poll when there are no files currently in the local directory.
They also are configured with a `FileSystemPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` in the `local-filter` by default.

The regex and pattern filters can now be configured to always pass directories.
This can be useful when using recursion in the outbound gateways.

All the Inbound Channel Adapters (streaming and synchronization-based) now use an appropriate `AbstractPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` implementation by default to prevent remote files duplicate downloads.

The FTP and SFTP outbound gateways now support the `REPLACE_IF_MODIFIED` `FileExistsMode` when fetching remote files.

The (S)FTP streaming inbound channel adapters now add remote file information in a message header.

The FTP and SFTP outbound channel adapters, as well as `PUT` command of the outbound gateways, now support `InputStream` as `payload`, too.

See <<ftp>> and <<sftp>> for more information.

==== Integration Properties

Since _version 4.3.2_ a new `spring.integration.readOnly.headers` global property has been added to customize the list of headers which should not be copied to a newly created `Message` by the `MessageBuilder`.
See <<global-properties>> for more information.

==== Stream Changes

There is a new option on the `CharacterStreamReadingMessageSource` to allow it to be used to "pipe" stdin and publish an application event when the pipe is closed.
See <<stream-reading>> for more information.

==== Barrier Changes

The `BarrierMessageHandler` now supports a discard channel to which late-arriving trigger messages are sent.
See <<barrier>> for more information.

==== AMQP Changes

The AMQP outbound endpoints now support setting a delay expression for when using the RabbitMQ Delayed Message Exchange plugin.
See <<amqp-delay>> for more information.

The inbound endpoints now support the Spring AMQP `DirectMessageListenerContainer`.
See <<amqp-inbound-channel-adapter>> for more information.

Pollable AMQP-backed channels now block the poller thread for the poller's configured `receiveTimeout` (default 1 second).
See <<amqp-channels>> for more information.

==== HTTP Changes

The `DefaultHttpHeaderMapper.userDefinedHeaderPrefix` property is now an empty string by default instead of `X-`.
See <<http-header-mapping>> for more information.

==== Aggregator Performance Changes

Aggregators now use a `SimpleSequenceSizeReleaseStrategy` by default, which is more efficient, especially with large groups.
Empty groups are now scheduled for removal after `empty-group-min-timeout`.
See <<aggregator>> for more information.

==== MQTT Changes

Inbound messages are now mapped with headers `RECEIVED_TOPIC`, `RECEIVED_QOS` and `RECEIVED_RETAINED` to avoid inadvertent propagation to outbound messages when an application is relaying messages.

The outbound channel adapter now supports expressions for the topic, qos and retained properties; the defaults remain the same.

See <<mqtt>> for more information.

==== STOMP Changes

The STOMP module has been changed to use `ReactorNettyTcpStompClient`, based on the Project Reactor `3.0` and `reactor-netty` extension.
The `Reactor2TcpStompSessionManager` has been renamed to the `ReactorNettyTcpStompSessionManager` according to the `ReactorNettyTcpStompClient` foundation.

See <<stomp>> for more information.

==== Web Services Changes

- The `WebServiceOutboundGateway` s can now be supplied with an externally configured `WebServiceTemplate` instances.

- The `DefaultSoapHeaderMapper` can now map a `javax.xml.transform.Source` user-defined header to a SOAP header element.

- Simple WebService Inbound and Outbound gateways can now deal with the complete `WebServiceMessage` as a `payload`, allowing the manipulation of MTOM attachments.

See <<ws>> for more information.
