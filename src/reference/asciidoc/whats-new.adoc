== What's new in Spring Integration 5.0?

This chapter provides an overview of the new features and improvements that have been introduced with Spring
Integration 5.0.
If you are interested in more details, please see the Issue Tracker tickets that were resolved as part of the 5.0
development process.

[[x5.0-new-components]]
=== New Components

==== MongoDB Outbound Gateway

The new `MongoDbOutboundGateway` allows you to make queries to the database on demand by sending a message to its request channel.
See <<mongodb-outbound-gateway>> for more information.

[[x5.0-general]]
=== General Changes

Spring Integration is now fully based on Spring Framework `5.0` and Project Reactor `3.0`.
The previous Project Reactor versions aren't supported any more.

==== Core Changes

The `@Poller` annotation now has the `errorChannel` attribute for easier configuration of the underlying `MessagePublishingErrorHandler`.
See <<annotations>> for more information.

All the request-reply endpoints (based on `AbstractReplyProducingMessageHandler`) can now start transaction and, therefore, make the whole downstream flow transactional.
See <<tx-handle-message-advice>> for more information.

==== JMS Changes

Previously, Spring Integration JMS XML configuration used a default bean name `connectionFactory` for the JMS Connection Factory, allowing the property to be omitted from component definitions.
It has now been renamed to `jmsConnectionFactory`, which is the bean name used by Spring Boot to auto-configure the JMS Connection Factory bean.

If your application is relying on the previous behavior, rename your `connectionFactory` bean to `jmsConnectionFactory`, or specifically configure your components to use your bean using its current name.

==== Gateway Changes

The gateway now correctly sets the `errorChannel` header when the gateway method has a `void` return type and an error channel is provided.
Previously, the header was not populated.
This had the effect that synchronous downstream flows (running on the calling thread) would send the exception to the configured channel but an exception on an async downstream flow would be sent to the default `errorChannel` instead.
See <<gateway-error-handling>> for more information.

==== Mail Changes

Some inconsistencies with rendering IMAP mail content have been resolved.
See <<imap-format-important, the note in the Mail-Receiving Channel Adapter Section>> for more information.

==== Feed Changes

Instead of the `com.rometools.fetcher.FeedFetcher`, which is deprecated in ROME, a new `Resource` property has been introduced to the `FeedEntryMessageSource`.
See <<feed>> for more information.


==== File Changes

The new `FileHeaders.RELATIVE_PATH` Message header has been introduced to represent relative path in the `FileReadingMessageSource`.
See <<file-reading>> for more information.

The tail adapter now supports `idleEventInterval` to emit events when there is no data in the file during that period.
See <<file-tailing>> for more information.

==== (S)FTP Changes

The inbound channel adapters now have a property `max-fetch-size` which is used to limit the number of files fetched during a poll when there are no files currently in the local directory.

The regex and pattern filters can now be configured to always pass directories.
This can be useful when using recursion in the outbound gateways.
See <<ftp-outbound-gateway>> and <<sftp-outbound-gateway>> for more information.

==== Integration Properties

Since _version 4.3.2_ a new `spring.integration.readOnly.headers` global property has been added to customize the list of headers which should not be copied to a newly created `Message` by the `MessageBuilder`.
See <<global-properties>> for more information.

==== Stream Changes

There is a new option on the `CharacterStreamReadingMessageSource` to allow it to be used to "pipe" stdin and publish an application event when the pipe is closed.
See <<stream-reading>> for more information.

==== Barrier Changes

The `BarrierMessageHandler` now supports a discard channel to which late-arriving trigger messages are sent.
See <<barrier>> for more information.

==== AMQP Changes

The AMQP outbound endpoints now support setting a delay expression for when using the RabbitMQ Delayed Message Exchange plugin.
See <<amqp-delay>> for more information.

The inbound endpoints now support the Spring AMQP `DirectMessageListenerContainer`.
See <<amqp-inbound-channel-adapter>> for more information.

==== HTTP Changes

The `DefaultHttpHeaderMapper.userDefinedHeaderPrefix` property is now an empty string by default instead of `X-`.
See <<http-header-mapping>> for more information.

==== Aggregator Performance Changes

Aggregators now use a `SimpleSequenceSizeReleaseStrategy` by default, which is more efficient, especially with large groups.
Empty groups are now scheduled for removal after `empty-group-min-timeout`.
See <<aggregator>> for more information.

==== MQTT Changes

Inbound messages are now mapped with headers `RECEIVED_TOPIC`, `RECEIVED_QOS` and `RECEIVED_RETAINED` to avoid inadvertent propagation to outbound messages when an application is relaying messages.

The outbound channel adapter now supports expressions for the topic, qos and retained properties; the defaults remain the same.

See <<mqtt>> for more information.

==== STOMP Changes

The STOMP module has been changed to use `ReactorNettyTcpStompClient`, based on the Project Reactor `3.0` and `reactor-netty` extension.
The `Reactor2TcpStompSessionManager` has been renamed to the `ReactorNettyTcpStompSessionManager` according to the `ReactorNettyTcpStompClient` foundation.

See <<stomp>> for more information.
